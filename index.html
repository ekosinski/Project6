<h2>Two-Lane Terror</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The roads are more dangerous than usualy as a massive garbage revolt has occured.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
In Two-Lane Terror playser must continously attempt to dodge oncoming garbage trucks.  If the player ever hits the truck they lose the game.  The player will continue to gain points as long as there alive like an endless runner. The player should continue to have the urge to play Two-Lane Terror in order to score higher points.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Two-Lane Terror is based off of the endless runner genre.  Players will continue to play the game until their inevitable death.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players will use the mouse to move the truck around the road.  If the player touches the truck they will lose the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of my prototype is not only to test out moving an object with the mouse(something I have not tried out yet), but to also see if I can cause an object to keep moving back infront of the screen as if is a whole new object.  This will allow me to respawn objects without having to create and destroy them over and over.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Two-Lane Terror like other endless runners has the awesome feature of addiction.  Players continue to strive to gain a higher score.  It is always exciting to see who lasts the longest in games like this.
